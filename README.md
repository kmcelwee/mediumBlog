# mediumBlog
Jupyter notebooks for [my blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@kmcelwee). As development on each independent project grew, it became wiser to have a more distributed model instead of having them all in one repo. Here are links to the existing projects:

* The development of `load_forecast` was moved to [`kmcelwee/load-forecasting`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/load-forecasting/)
* The development of `reddit_says_aww.py` was moved to [`kmcelwee/reddit-says-aww`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/reddit-says-aww)
* The development of `multiplicative_persistence` was moved to [`kmcelwee/multiplicative-persistence`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/multiplicative-persistence)
* The development of `tsp` has been moved to [`kmcelwee/tsp`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/tsp/)
* The dataset of 2020 Democratic primary Spotify data was moved to [`kmcelwee/2020-spotify`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/2020-spotify)
* The development of `florida` has been moved to [`kmcelwee/florida`](https://github.com/kmcelwee/florida/)
* `weakestLink.ipynb` was published [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/kmcelwee/f7aaccf92b366352dbe33a26ad1bda65)
